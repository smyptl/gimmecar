        b &nbsp;We makes no warranties, express, implied or apparent, regarding the vehicle, no warranty of merchantability and no warranty that the vehicle is fit for a particular purpose.
      li
        u Condition and Return of Vehicle.
        | &nbsp;You must return the vehicle to our rental office or other location we specify, on the date and time specified in this Agreement, and in the same condition that you received it, except for ordinary wear. Service to the Vehicle or replacement of parts or accessories during the rental must have our prior approval. You will check and maintain all fluid levels. We may repossess the Vehicle at your expense without notice to you, if the vehicle is abandoned or used in violation of law or this agreement.

      li
        u Responsbility for damage or loss; Reporting to Police.
        | &nbsp;You are responsible for all physical and mechanical damage to the Vehicle, missing equipment, and our administrative expenses connected with any damage claim in accordance with Cal. Civil Code section 1936, whether or not you are at fault. You are responsible for loss due to theft of the vehicle and all damage due to vandalism that occurs in connection with a theft, if you fail to exercise ordinary care while in possession of the vehicle. You are responsible for damage due to vandalism not associated with theft of the vehicle up to a maximum of $500. Allowing a person who is not an authorized driver to use the vehicle is not an exercise of ordinary care, but a willful, and reckless act and is a breach of this agreement. You must report all accidents involving the vehicle of theft of the vehicle and vandalism to us within 24 hours of occurrence, and to the police as soon as you discover them.

      li
        u Collision Damage Waiver.
        | &nbsp;If you accept and pay for CDW upon return of the vehicle or termination of this agreement, we will waive our right to collect from you for physical and mechanical damage to, or loss of, the vehicle.
        b
          | &nbsp;We will not waive this right if damage to the vehicle results from:
          ol
            li your intentional, willful, wanton, or reckless conduct;
            li operation of the vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol in violation of section 23152 of the California vehicle code;
            li towing or pushing anything; or,
            li operation of the vehicle on an unpaved road if the damage or loss is a direct result of the road or driving conditions;

            li use of the vehicle in a speed test or contest, or in driver training activity;

        u Insurance.
        | &nbsp;You are responsible for all damage or loss you cause to others. You agree to provide primary auto liability, collision and comprehensive insurance covering you, us, and the vehicle. If you do not have liability insurance, or if state law requires us to have liability insurance, we will provide an auto liability insurance policy (the “Policy”) that is secondary to any other valid and collectible insurance whether primary, secondary, excess or contingent. The policy provides bodily injury and property damage liability coverage with limits no higher than minimum levels prescribed by the vehicular financial responsibility laws of the state where or loss occurs. The Policy provides uninsured or under-insured motorist coverage only in states where we are required by the law to provide it. Coverage is void if you breach the terms of this agreement or if you fail to cooperate in any loss investigation conducted by us or our insurer. You and we reject no-fault and uninsured or under-insured motorist coverage. Giving the vehicle to an unauthorized driver terminates our liability insurance, if any. If a liability loss occurs, this agreement shall be construed according to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the loss occurred.

        u Breach of Agreement.
        | &nbsp;The acts listed in paragraph 5, above, are prohibited uses of the vehicle and breaches of this agreement.
